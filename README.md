# juandaherrera.com — v6

My personal corner of the internet. A portfolio that showcases who I am, what I've built, and what I know. Rebuilt from scratch with a modern stack and a healthy dose of vibe coding.

> **This is the sixth (and best) iteration of my personal site.** Previous versions go back years, most recently [v5](https://github.com/juandaherrera/personal_web) which was built with Python + [Reflex](https://reflex.dev/). This version is a full rewrite in Next.js — faster, smoother, and vibecoded with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## ✨ What's inside

The site is organized into the following sections:

| Section | What you'll find |
|---|---|
| **Hero** | A quick intro and typewriter effect cycling through my roles |
| **About** | A bit more about who I am |
| **Tech Stack** | The tools and technologies I work with daily |
| **Experience** | My professional journey, company by company |
| **Projects** | Things I've built and shipped |
| **Education & Certifications** | Degrees, certs, and courses |
| **Footer** | Links, credits, and the vibecode disclosure |

Language switching (ES / EN) is supported across the whole site.

## 🤖 Vibecoded

This site was built with the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Most of the implementation, from component architecture to animation tuning, was done through AI-assisted pair programming. It was a fun experiment in what modern vibe coding can produce.
